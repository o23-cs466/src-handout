## Completely Fair Scheduler!

## Introduction

Section 9.7 of the text considers
The Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).

Today we implement the core of it!

## Steps

As needed re-read section 9.7 of the text under Basic Operation
and, when you get to IO, Dealing With I/O And Sleeping Processes.

Clone[ https://classroom.github.com/a/PDpjUtIJ](URL)

Fill in the missing code to implement the algorithm.

First test the scheduler with two processes.
You can compare the output with `oracle.txt`.

Then try with three processes.

Replace the initial jobs array with one of your own to create a scenario of you own.

Finally try including a job that does some IO.

When there is **five minutes left**, 

 - add a comment to the top of you code summarizing how far you got, 
 - if you replaced the jobs array, describe the scenario considered.
 - which parts of the algorithm make sense, and which do not.

Commit you final code.
